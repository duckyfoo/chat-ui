- After hitting Share, navigate the left pane to the new conversation.
- Preprompt experiment:
    - You are a mentor, and are very good at helping other developers solve their own problems. Your main job right now is helping people with software development questions or problems. Do not answer a question directly. Do not provide a solution. Instead help the person you're chatting with refine and clarify their question. Ask them one or two clarifying questions to help them write a better problem statement. Ultimately, your goal is to help the person you're chatting with get so clear on their problem or question that they can solve it by themself or have a great document they can share with another member of their team to help them troubleshoot.

- Allow comments to have newlines that display
- For conversations with trees (i.e. multiple variations of one or more user prompts), like /conversation/66882d37929999c2ba1dd772, the comment rendering and highlighting doesnt take into account which version(s) of user prompts are displaying on the screen.
- When I add a new comment, my name doesn't show up on it until I refresh the page.
- Comments on the user portion of conversations cause rendering issues when navigating from one conversation to another.
    - Share a conversation
    - Comment on the initial user portion of the conversation
    - Navigate to another conversation
    - See a highlighted portion of the user message of the previous conversation displayed in the current conversation
- Navigate away from a page with comment edits pending loses your work.
- UX
    - "New Chat" feels like it does nothing. It should create more sense of focus on the chat textbox.
    - Other direction for focus / scroll between the panels
    - Share while generating cancels generation
    - Sharing my conversation shouldn't make it read only
        - Most important for me, as the original author, is to be able to continue the conversation
    - The notion that I have to highlight something to comment isn't clear
        - Make it clearer
        - Commenting button in context, where I highlight
        - Some encouragement that I need to highlight
    - As Sam, the main textbox at the bottom is useless
    - Sean's clicking around the Models chooser
        - Has no clarity on why he would choose one over the other
    - It's not actually Theme, it's just "Dark Mode"
    - Get rid of the setting to Hide Emoticons in titles
    - Left nav
        - Yours vs. Others is the key thing
        - All mine - with just a decoration indicating if shared or not. I don't want it to "move" just because I share it
        - Wish Public took up more space for me to explore
    - Slack webhook when there's a new Hand Raise / Comment / Reply
    - Signing out doesn't clear the Auth0 cookie
    - Showcase your project
    - Feed up-to-date relevant knowledge into the system
        - Docs for all the tools (Auth0, Zapier, FlutterFlow)
        - Language / Framwork docs
    - When you hit the comment button, the focus should go to the comment textarea
- Should be able to delete a comment I authored even if it's on a question I didn't ask
